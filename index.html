She's an enthusiatic kindergartener whose curriosites and inquisitve mind keep me busy constanly. I often volunteer in her classroom during their weekly art lessons and library visits. Both activites combine the things Marley and I both love doing together, art and reading.</p></center>

	<center><p class="aquamarine-paragraph">My educational journey has only just begun as I am currently enrolled at community college for my second Associates Degree in Visual Communications with emphasis in fashion and design. I hope to merge my new found interest in coding and programming with my passion for fashion. Along with the web development skills I will attain at MakerPrep, I have also accepted a seat at General Assembly's Downtown Los Angeles cohort to learn UX design.</p></center>

	<center><p class="tomato-paragraph">I first learned about coding through a coalition of women working in tech, called Girl Develop It! They lead me to MakersSquare and General Assembly, as well as a whole world of inspiring women in tech!</p></center>
